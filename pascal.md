## Rewrite the question in your own words:

## What assumptions will you make about this problem if you cannot ask any more clarifying questions? What are your reasons for making those assumptions?

## Which data structure(s) do you think you'll use? What pros/cons do you see with that choice?


## Write out a few lines of initial pseudocode: (mid-level design, this should be short, and not be real code)
